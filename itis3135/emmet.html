            <li><strong>Why the Atlantic Ocean?</strong> My husband and I often try to take trips to the beach every year during the fall. Some reasons are:</li>
            <ul class="content-inner">
                <li>The ocean is so peaceful and it allows us to clear our minds. With everything going on in our lives and within the world, the ocean
                    offers space.</li>
                <li>Ocean life is beautiful! During our 2021 trip (pictured above), I was lucky enough to see a very, very large Stringray jump out of the water
                    while hunting for food. I think about it often and it allows me to appreciate the world we're granted to be in.
                </li>
                <li>You're disconnected from the social life and the internet. Sometimes, having no internet or cell phone service is the best thing for someone.
                </li>
                <li>You'll never miss a catch (unless you just have really bad luck)! Life in the ocean is large and wide. If you enjoy fishing and the thrill of
                    something hooking your line, try ocean fishing! You never know what's at the end of your line!
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Take a trip and live out of your world as often as you can. Life is short. &hearts;</p>
